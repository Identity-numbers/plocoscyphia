# About

Research on turbulence and fluid dynamics in an extinct sponge from the Creatous period, ca 80 million years ago, Plocoscyphia (probably Plocoscyphia Roemeri?)

The inspiration for this repository comes from a mix of fossil examples of the sponge found in southern Sweden, Sk√•ne and the work of an American physicist at the University of Chicago, William T. Irvine.

If anything of significance is found, William will be contacted and pointed to this repository.
